Tears of the Kingdom is a direct sequel to <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>. This game released roughly 6 years prior and acted as the launch title for the Nintendo Switch console on <u>March 3rd, 2017</u>. It released to 
glowing reviews and widespread acclaim, and sold upwards of 20 million units. Critics called it an open-world adventure game that pushed the barriers that games imposed on themselves prior. It was truly "open air", meaning there are no invisible walls, barriers or any form of limiting 
the player's freedom. It is still highly regarded today, and it's influences are seen in many other open world games that have released since.
</p> <p class="main-text">
Due to how beloved Breath of the Wild was, Nintendo had a heavy burden in order to create a sequel that can truly be called a successor to what is widely considered as one of the greatest games ever made, in a 
franchise that is already played and loved by millions across the world. But despite this seemingly impossible task, the Zelda team aren't know for ever being deterred, and they were more than up to the challenge. And so, 
development on <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> began only months after finishing development on Breath of the Wild.
