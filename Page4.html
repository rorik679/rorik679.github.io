<h1> Part 4: Release & Critics </h1>

<p class="main-text"> <b> The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom released on the 12th of May 2023 for €69.99, exclusively on Nintendo Switch. </b> </p>

<p class="main-text"> Before release though, between the the 2nd and 3rd of May 2023, datamined ROMs of the game leaked online, and people were able to successfully emulate the game on a PC. This leak was one of the most 
disastrous that's ever happened to a game pre-release, as people were able to not only obtain the game for free and play it on illegal hardware, but they were completing it early and spoiling people who were planning on 
playing the game legally at launch. Those who were looking forward to release had to avoid spoilers being spread everywhere online. <br><br>
Nintendo started cracking down harshly on anyone spreading these illegal copies, and started a hunt to try find the person responsible. There are no reports of the person ever being found. 
</p>

<p class="main-text"> Regardless, the game's release schedule continued, and between 2-3 days before the game released Nintendo lifted the review embargo on journalists. </p>

<p class="main-text"> Tears of the Kingdom opened to glowing 10/10 reviews across the board. Below you'll find some of the biggest gaming journalism networks and their reviews on the game. </p>

<p class="caption"> "A glorious, triumphant sequel to one of the best video games of all time." Alana Hagues, Nintendo Life </p>

<p class="main-text"> Asking the gaming community to get along is usually a Sisyphean task, but in the weeks following Tears of the Kingdom's release practically everyone was just simply enjoying the game and talking about 
it together. This time is always my favourite example of how amazing video games can be for bringing people together no matter who they are, and sharing one singular thing that they all have a unified love for. 
</p>

<p class="main-text"> The Legend of Zelda had once again proved why it's widely considered the greatest video game series in history. </p>
