<h1> Part 3: Announcement Schedule </h1>

<p class="main-text"> <b> The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was announced on the 11th of June 2019, during Nintendo's "E3 2019 Nintendo Direct". </b> </p>

<p class="main-text"> Before we begin, its worth explaining what a Nintendo Direct is, since they'll be mentioned quite often here.
<br><br>
A "Nintendo Direct" is a presentation that Nintendo streams live to fans on YouTube every few months (although there was a significantly large gap without one in 2020, to the dismay of fans). They're typically roughly 40 minutes long and features announcements
for the latest games available on Nintendo platforms. Back when the massive gaming convention E3 was still running, Nintendo would do a special Nintendo Direct presentation featuring their biggest games and announcements.
</p>

<p class="main-text"> As mentioned earlier, Tears of the Kingdom was initially announced at one such presentation, with a teaser trailer that was only short but still had fans worldwide over the moon with excitement. You 
can see the "E3 2019 Teaser" below. Note that at this point the title of the game had not been revealed, and it was only referred to as "The Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild".
</p>

<p class="main-text"> Following this announcement, there was absolutely zero information for 2 years. The only time Nintendo mentioned the game officially was during the announcement of a spin-off to Breath of the Wild, where 
the producer Eiji Aonuma simply stated that development is "going smoothly". This of course was a very long wait for Zelda fans.
</p>

<p class="main-text"> Thankfully though, the wait paid off. On the 15th of June 2021, in Nintendo's E3 2021 Nintendo Direct (the last they'd ever do as E3 shut down after 2021), the presentation concluded with the second teaser trailer for The Sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
The tone of this trailer was very different to the first, being very bright and explosive, and it was the original reveal of the game's Sky Islands.

<p class="main-text"> You may have noticed that this teaser trailer ended with a release window reveal of 2022. The original plan was actually for the game to release this year, however it was revealed in the next announcement 
on the 29th of March 2022 that the team had made the decision to delay the game to Spring 2023. This announcement video also doubled as a small teaser, with a previously unrevealed scene being featured in the middle. After release, producer 
Eiji Aonuma stated that the delay was simply to make sure the game was as polished and stable as it could be, as it was an extremely demanding game tech-wise and it was running on very old hardware. He recalls that the game was 
actually basically finished by the time of March 2022 but that they didn't feel satisfied with the game's performance and stability. It's worth noting that a game being delayed like this just for the sake of polishing is exceedingly 
rare in the gaming industry these days.

<p class="main-text"> 6 months later, on the 13th of September 2022, the next trailer was revealed in the conclusion of Nintendo's September 2022 Nintendo Direct. This trailer was the first to not be considered a "teaser", 
and is referred to as "Official Trailer #1". More importantly, however, this was the first ever reveal of the game's title, "The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom", and also revealed the release date of the 12th of May 2023. 
This marked the beginning of the game emerging from the mystery that shrouded it, and from here are reveals were more common.

<p class="main-text"> Only five months later, on the 8th of February 2023, Official Trailer #2 was revealed as the conclusion of the February 2023 Nintendo Direct. This was the first time Tears of the Kingdom had been 
featured in a Nintendo Direct twice in a row. This trailer was by far the longest and most packed trailer we had seen so far. This was the reveal of the Ultrahand mechanic and also featured the first voice lines we had 
heard from the game. While it wouldn't be officialy stated until later, fans were able to deduce that legendary video game voice actor Matthew Mercer would be playing the antagonist role of Ganondorf.
</p>

<p class="main-text"> Alongside all that, this trailer actually featured the first shots of The Depths. However, Nintendo wouldn't ever acknowledge the existence of this hidden third layer to the game world until after 
the game releases. The mysterious nature of The Depths hugely contributed to the anticipation of fans, and made for an incredible surprise when players discovered the area for themselves.
</p>

<p class="main-text"> At this point the game started to enter its release window, so marketing ramped up and small bits of information were dropped randomly in the remaining 3 months until release. I won't over those, as they're
relatively inconsequential. On the 28th of March 2023, however, producer Eiji Aonuma released a 13-minute long gameplay demonstration. This footage was by far the longest we had gotten so far, even longer than all of the previous 
trailers combined. It was also the first time we saw raw gameplay, and when we got a proper introduction to the game's core abilities; Ultrahand, Fuse, Ascend, and Recall. These four abilities were the main focus of the demonstration, 
though it did also feature some of a new area too, the Great Sky Island.

<p class="main-text"> By this point, we had reached the endgame. Following the gameplay demo Nintendo was much more open about the game and started creating advertisements and updating the game's website. </p>

<p class="main-text"> On the 13th of April 2023, Nintendo officially released the final trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, after almost 6 years. "Official Trailer #3" came in at 4 minutes, and was an incredibly 
well composed trailer that featured the best the game had to offer, with an original soundtrack composed specifically for it. This trailer blew expectations out of the water and made Tears of the Kingdom the #1 subject in the gaming discussion, 
with the YouTube video garnering 17 million views as of writing. To this day many consider it to be one of the greatest trailers ever made for a video game.

<p class="main-text"> Needless to say, following this trailer the excitement had reached an all time high. On the 26th of April 2023 journalists were allowed to share footage of them playing the game themselves at an event, 
where they had the opportunity to try out the game's unique mechanics and problem-solving opportunities. 
</p>

<p class="main-text"> And with that, there was only two weeks left until the release, and Tears of the Kingdom entered its release window. <br><br>
The road to Tears of the Kingdom's release was one of the longest of a game in recent history, and much of that time was spent doing nothing but waiting. But even though Nintendo remained silent, the Zelda community was 
buzzing the whole time, with non-stop theories and discussions and rumours. In this sense, the lead-up to Tears of the Kingdom was in itself a very special thing to have been there for. It's not often a game has such a vibrant 
community long before it ever even releases. So, even if the next entry in the Zelda series takes another 6 years still, I'd be more than happy to do it all again.
